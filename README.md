# Welcome to wLiquify Documentation

wLiquify is a revolutionary DeFi protocol that centralizes top cryptocurrencies on Solana while creating the first truly decentralized market index. Our protocol enables efficient trading of major cryptocurrencies on Solana's high-performance network while incentivizing cross-chain liquidity through our innovative deposit bonus mechanism.

This documentation site is your central hub for understanding everything about the wLiquify ecosystem. Whether you're an end-user looking to trade top cryptocurrencies on Solana, a liquidity provider interested in earning deposit bonuses, or a developer looking to integrate with our protocol, you'll find the information you need here.

## Why wLiquify?

We believe in building a more accessible and efficient DeFi ecosystem. wLiquify aims to achieve this by:

*   **Centralized DeFi on Solana**: Enable trading of top cryptocurrencies on Solana by utilizing Wormhole NTT for cross-chain transfers, providing efficient trading with low fees and high performance.
*   **Decentralized Market Index**: Create the first truly decentralized crypto index with automated rebalancing through market forces.
*   **Incentivized Cross-Chain Liquidity**: Reward users who bring liquidity to Solana through our pool with deposit bonuses that cover bridging and LP costs.

## How the Ecosystem Works: A Quick Overview

The wLiquify ecosystem is composed of several key components working in concert:

1.  **Frontend dApp (`wLiquify DApp`)**: The primary interface for users to trade tokens, deposit assets to receive wLQI LP tokens, and withdraw assets by redeeming wLQI. Currently supports manual bridging through Wormhole NTT, with plans for automated cross-chain routing in the future.

2.  **Liquidity Pool Program (`w-liquify-pool`)**: An on-chain Solana program that manages our multi-asset liquidity pool. It handles deposits, withdrawals, wLQI LP token minting/burning, and our innovative deposit bonus mechanism.

3.  **Oracle Program (`oracle_program`)**: A custom on-chain Solana program that aggregates price data from Pyth and provides crucial market information for pool operations and token valuations.

4.  **Oracle Feeder Script (`wLiquify-Oracle`)**: An off-chain Node.js script responsible for sourcing market data from Pyth and feeding it into the on-chain Oracle Program.

5.  **Pool Maintainer Script (`poolMaintainer`)**: An off-chain Node.js script that performs automated maintenance tasks, including updating pool values and managing supported tokens.
