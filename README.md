This documentation is your guide to everything wLiquify. Whether you're looking to:

## What Makes wLiquify Special?

We're passionate about making DeFi more accessible and efficient. Here's how wLiquify stands out:

*   **Access Top Cryptos on Solana**: Seamlessly trade major cryptocurrencies directly on Solana. We use Wormhole NTT for secure cross-chain transfers, bringing premier digital assets to Solana's high-speed, low-cost environment.
*   **A Truly Decentralized, Asset-Backed Index**: Invest in a transparent crypto index that automatically rebalances based on market forces. Unlike futures-based indexes driven by oracle prices, when you invest in our index, you're investing in the actual underlying assets, reflecting their true market dominance. This means our index performance aims for a 1:1 reflection of the real top 30 crypto performance.
*   **Earn as You Contribute with Incentivized Liquidity**: Get rewarded for bringing your assets to Solana. Our deposit bonus system is designed to cover your bridging and LP costs, making it attractive to deepen liquidity on Solana.

## How Does It All Work? A Quick Look Inside

The magic of wLiquify happens through a few key components working together:

1.  **Your Hub: The wLiquify dApp**: This is your user-friendly dashboard for trading, depositing assets to get wLQI LP tokens (your share of the pool!), and withdrawing your assets. It currently supports manual bridging with Wormhole NTT, and we're building towards automated cross-chain routing.
2.  **The Engine: Liquidity Pool Program (`w-liquify-pool`)**: Our on-chain Solana program is the heart of the system. It manages the multi-asset liquidity pool, handles your deposits and withdrawals, mints/burns wLQI LP tokens, and powers our innovative deposit bonus and dynamic fee mechanisms (which rely on data from our custom on-chain oracle).
3.  **The Price Engine: Pyth Network Integration**: For valuing the actual assets in our pool, especially Wormhole-wrapped tokens that might lack deep liquidity on Solana, we integrate price feeds from the Pyth Network. This ensures that the pool's value is always based on real-world market prices, making our index truly asset-backed.
4.  **The Index Brain: Custom wLiquify Oracle System**:
    *   **On-Chain Oracle Program (`oracle_program`)**: This custom Solana program stores the official list of tokens in our dynamic index (e.g., Top 30), their target market dominance (weights), and the specific Pyth `price_feed_id` for each. This data is crucial for the Liquidity Pool Program to calculate dynamic fees/bonuses for rebalancing.
    *   **Off-Chain Oracle Feeder (`wLiquify-Oracle`)**: An automated script, managed by the wLiquify team, that monitors the market, determines the Top X tokens and their target dominances, and securely updates the on-chain `oracle_program`. This process, while initiated off-chain for data gathering, results in transparent, on-chain parameters for the index.
5.  **The Caretaker: Pool Maintainer Script (`poolMaintainer`)**: This off-chain script keeps things running smoothly by performing automated maintenance, like updating certain pool values based on oracle data and managing the list of supported tokens in conjunction with the oracle system.
