# Welcome to wLiquify Documentation

wLiquify is a decentralized protocol offering innovative liquidity solutions on the Solana blockchain. Our goal is to provide a transparent, efficient, and user-friendly platform for managing digital assets and participating in liquidity provision.

This documentation site is your central hub for understanding everything about the wLiquify ecosystem. Whether you're an end-user looking to utilize the dApp, a developer interested in our on-chain programs, or an operator managing our off-chain services, you'll find the information you need here.

## Why wLiquify?

We believe in building a financial system that is open, accessible, and empowers users. wLiquify aims to contribute to this vision by:

*   **Transparency**: All our core components, including on-chain programs, are open-source and verifiable. This documentation further aims to clarify how every piece works.
*   **Efficiency**: Leveraging the speed and low cost of the Solana network to provide a seamless user experience.
*   **User-Centric Design**: Focusing on intuitive interfaces and clear explanations to make DeFi accessible to a broader audience.

## How the Ecosystem Works: A Quick Overview

The wLiquify ecosystem is composed of several key components working in concert:

1.  **Frontend dApp (`wLiquify DApp`)**: This is the primary interface for end-users. It allows for swapping tokens and interacting with the liquidity pool (depositing assets to receive wLQI LP tokens, and withdrawing assets by redeeming wLQI).

2.  **Liquidity Pool Program (`w-liquify-pool`)**: An on-chain Solana program that manages the multi-asset liquidity pool. It handles the logic for deposits, withdrawals, minting/burning of wLQI LP tokens, and fee calculations.

3.  **Oracle Program (`oracle_program`)**: A custom on-chain Solana program that aggregates and provides crucial data (like token dominance and price feed IDs) to other components, particularly the Liquidity Pool Program.

4.  **Oracle Feeder Script (`wLiquify-Oracle`)**: An off-chain Node.js script responsible for sourcing market data (e.g., from Pyth) and reliably feeding it into the on-chain Oracle Program.

5.  **Pool Maintainer Script (`poolMaintainer`)**: An off-chain Node.js script that performs automated maintenance tasks for the Liquidity Pool Program, such as updating the total pool value, adding new supported tokens, and cleaning up historical data.

**(Diagram placeholder: A high-level diagram illustrating these components and their interactions would be beneficial here.)**
