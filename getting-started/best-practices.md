# Best Practices

Tips for using wLiquify safely and effectively.

## Security & Best Practices for Using wLiquify

Interacting with any DeFi platform requires caution and awareness. Here are some best practices to follow when using the wLiquify dApp:

### General Security
-   **Verify URLs**: Always double-check that you are on the official wLiquify dApp website before connecting your wallet or signing any transactions. Bookmark the correct URL to avoid phishing sites.

-   **Approve Transactions Carefully**: Before approving any transaction in your wallet:
    -   Thoroughly review all transaction details displayed by your wallet.
    -   Understand what actions you are authorizing (e.g., sending tokens, interacting with a smart contract).
    -   If something looks suspicious or unclear, reject the transaction and seek clarification from official channels.

-   **Manage RPC Endpoints**: While the dApp allows you to use custom Solana RPC endpoints, ensure any custom RPC you use is trusted and reliable. Malicious RPCs could potentially censor transactions or provide false information. Sticking to well-known public RPCs or your own private node is generally safer.

-   **Secure Your Wallet**: Your wallet's security is paramount.
    -   Use strong, unique passwords for your wallet.
    -   Keep your seed phrase (recovery phrase) secret and stored securely offline. Never share it with anyone or enter it on any website.
    -   Beware of phishing scams and unsolicited messages asking for your wallet details or seed phrase.
    -   Consider using a hardware wallet for an extra layer of security, especially for significant amounts.

### Cross-Chain Bridging
-   **Verify Token Compatibility**:
    -   Ensure the token you want to bridge has a Wormhole NTT wrapped version on Solana
    -   Check that the token is whitelisted in the wLiquify pool before bridging
    -   Verify the correct token contract addresses on both chains
    -   Use Portal Token Origin Verifier to find source chain details
    -   Double-check token addresses before bridging

-   **Manage Gas Costs**:
    -   Monitor gas prices on source chains before bridging
    -   Consider network congestion when planning transactions
    -   Keep extra gas for potential failed transactions
    -   Account for typical bridging costs (0.5-1.5%)
    -   Include DeBridge transfer fees in calculations

-   **Bridge Security**:
    -   Use official Wormhole NTT interfaces
    -   Verify transaction confirmations on both chains
    -   Keep transaction hashes for reference
    -   Monitor bridge status during high network activity
    -   Use Portal Transfer for Wormhole NTT operations
    -   Verify token origins through Portal Token Origin Verifier

-   **Bridging Process**:
    -   Always verify token addresses before starting
    -   Follow the complete bridging process:
        1. Find token in wLiquify pool
        2. Use Portal Token Origin Verifier
        3. Bridge to source chain via DeBridge
        4. Purchase source token
        5. Use Portal Transfer to bridge to Solana
        6. Deposit into wLiquify pool
    -   Keep track of all transaction hashes
    -   Monitor each step of the process
    -   Verify token receipt before depositing

### Liquidity Management

    -   Monitor token weights and target percentages
    -   Consider deposit bonuses for underweight tokens
    -   Be aware of withdrawal fees for overweight tokens

-   **Managing wLQI Tokens**:
    -   Keep track of your wLQI balance and value
    -   Monitor pool TVL and token weights
    -   Consider the impact of fees on your position
    -   Plan withdrawals based on token weights

-   **Risk Management**:
    -   Diversify across multiple tokens
    -   Monitor market conditions
    -   Set clear entry and exit strategies
    -   Keep emergency funds for gas fees

### Transaction Management
-   **Network Settings**:
    -   Ensure wallet and dApp are on the same network
    -   Use appropriate priority fees for timely processing
    -   Monitor transaction status in your wallet
    -   Keep transaction hashes for reference

-   **Error Handling**:
    -   Save transaction details before signing
    -   Note error messages for troubleshooting
