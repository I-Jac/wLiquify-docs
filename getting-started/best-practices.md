Tips for using wLiquify safely and effectively.

## Security & Best Practices for Using wLiquify

Interacting with any DeFi platform requires caution and awareness. Here are some best practices to follow when using the wLiquify dApp:

-   **Verify URLs**: Always double-check that you are on the official wLiquify dApp website before connecting your wallet or signing any transactions. Bookmark the correct URL to avoid phishing sites.

-   **Approve Transactions Carefully**: Before approving any transaction in your wallet:
    -   Thoroughly review all transaction details displayed by your wallet.
    -   Understand what actions you are authorizing (e.g., sending tokens, interacting with a smart contract).
    -   If something looks suspicious or unclear, reject the transaction and seek clarification from official channels.

-   **Manage RPC Endpoints**: While the dApp allows you to use custom Solana RPC endpoints, ensure any custom RPC you use is trusted and reliable. Malicious RPCs could potentially censor transactions or provide false information. Sticking to well-known public RPCs or your own private node is generally safer.

-   **Secure Your Wallet**: Your wallet's security is paramount.
    -   Use strong, unique passwords for your wallet.
    -   Keep your seed phrase (recovery phrase) secret and stored securely offline. Never share it with anyone or enter it on any website.
    -   Beware of phishing scams and unsolicited messages asking for your wallet details or seed phrase.
    -   Consider using a hardware wallet for an extra layer of security, especially for significant amounts.

-   **Token Approvals (if applicable)**: While many Solana dApps, including wLiquify for core pool interactions, use direct transfers or temporary authority rather than indefinite token approvals, always be mindful of any transaction that asks for broad permissions over your tokens. If such a feature were ever introduced, understand what you are approving and for how long.

-   **Stay Informed**: Follow official wLiquify announcements for any security updates or important information.

-   **Understand the Risks**: DeFi and liquidity provision involve inherent risks, including smart contract vulnerabilities and impermanent loss. Ensure you understand these risks before participating.
