## The Current Path: Bringing Your Assets to Solana

Right now, here's a high-level look at how you bring assets into the wLiquify ecosystem:

1.  **Prepare on the Source Chain**: You might need to bridge assets *to* the original chain of the token you want (if it's not already there) and acquire the specific token.
2.  **Bridge to Solana**: Use Wormhole NTT to bring the token securely to the Solana network.
3.  **Deposit & Earn**: Deposit your newly bridged, Wormhole-wrapped token into the wLiquify pool and start earning your deposit bonus!

We're constantly working on making this even easier with **future improvements** like automated cross-chain routing and a more integrated frontend experience.
