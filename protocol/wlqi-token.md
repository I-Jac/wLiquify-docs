# wLQI Token

## Overview

The wLQI token is wLiquify's liquidity provider token, representing a user's share in the multi-asset liquidity pool. It is minted when users deposit assets and burned when they withdraw, with its value directly tied to the total value locked (TVL) in the pool.

## Token Mechanics

### Valuation
The wLQI token price is calculated as:
```
wLQI Price = Total Value Locked (TVL) / wLQI Circulation Supply
```

Where:
- TVL = Sum of all token values in the pool
- Token values = Amount Ã— Pyth price feed
- wLQI Circulation Supply = Total minted - Total burned

### Minting Process
1. **Deposit Trigger**
   - User deposits tokens
   - Pyth price feed verifies value
   - Dynamic fee calculation
   - wLQI tokens minted

2. **Amount Calculation**
   - Based on deposit value
   - Adjusted by fees/bonuses
   - Oracle-verified pricing
   - Pool weight consideration

### Burning Process
1. **Withdrawal Trigger**
   - User withdraws tokens
   - Pyth price feed verifies value
   - Dynamic fee calculation
   - wLQI tokens burned

2. **Amount Calculation**
   - Based on withdrawal value
   - Adjusted by fees/bonuses
   - Oracle-verified pricing
   - Pool weight consideration

## Dynamic Fee Impact

### Fee Implementation
1. **Minting Adjustment**
   - Overweight tokens: Reduced minting
   - Underweight tokens: Increased minting
   - Fee-based adjustments
   - Oracle-verified weights

2. **Burning Adjustment**
   - Overweight tokens: Increased burning
   - Underweight tokens: Reduced burning
   - Fee-based adjustments
   - Oracle-verified weights

### Fee Structure
1. **Base Fee**
   - 0.1% fixed fee
   - Applied to all operations
   - Protocol revenue
   - Pool maintenance

2. **Dynamic Fee**
   - Based on weight deviation
   - 0.2% per 1% deviation
   - Incentivizes balance
   - Oracle-based calculation
